# ProxyLink

ProxyLink is a velocity plugin designed to allow multi-proxy setups by using Redis as the central communication platform.
It was designed for the minecraft music festival "BXBW" in little time and is therefore not generic.
It can be used as a starting point to create a more generic version.
